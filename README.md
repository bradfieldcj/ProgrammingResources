Geeks for Geeks has a large number of great tutorials and lessons to learn the "under-the-hood" parts of programming as well as practical applications. If you want to know how to speed up your coding, look here.

*https://towardsdatascience.com/
Particularly useful tutorials on AI and machine learning

*https://www.freecodecamp.org
Free Code Camp offers a variety of lessons ranging from front-end web development (the default for the site) to covering college level statistics and linear algebra

*https://www.khanacademy.org/
Most people will laugh at this, but the Khan Academy, while built for high-school, is a great way to re-learn and brush up on statistics and base-level calculus. They've also started introducing computer science courses in their repetoire.

Paid Resources:
*https://www.udemy.com/
Udemy hosts a lot of courses for computer science. They are typically heavily web-dev, cloud, and datascience oriented. They're roughly $10 per course on sale. Never buy at full price from this site.

**Recommended instructors: Colt Steele, Frank Kane, Hadelin de Ponteves and Kiril Eremenko (SuperDataScience), Jose Portilla, Ardit Sulce.
**Use the 2x speed button to watch and listen. Udemy and other online classes tend to slow their videos to offer "more" ie: longer content.

*StackSkills (Coupons through Mashable.com)
Topics vary wildly, but hit business training to programming.

*https://www.udacity.com/
Offers a variety of free and paid lessons to prepare you for their training programs

*https://www.datacamp.com/home
An active learning portal for Python and R. Datascience heavy. SQL is being added.

*https://www.codecademy.com/
Another active learning portal for Python and R. Datascience heavy, but diversifying quickly toward hardware programming languages (eg: C).

Paid Training Programs:
*https://www.insight.com - Sponsored by Companies
*https://www.flatiron.com - Pay After Program
*https://www.springboard.com - I don't really like springboard... refers too much to DataCamp website. Just pay for DataCamp and complete Kaggle dataset processing
*https://www.udacity.com - Similar to Springboard, but lessons are designed better with more unique content. They have started diversifying courses offered, but I'm not sure how well that will work since they seem to be losing their focus and are becoming more like an online university.
